# Project Memory / Preferences

## Naming Conventions
- Avoid using the term "mobile" in file names, component names, routes, or identifiers when the functionality applies across multiple platforms (desktop + web), which will be the case unless specified through something like size breakpoints. Use neutral, scope-based names (e.g., `ProjectsScreen`, `TeamLayout`) instead of `ProjectsMobile`.

## UI / Platform Guidance
- When introducing responsive/adaptive views, prefer generic naming (`*Screen`, `*View`, `*Panel`) unless a feature is strictly platform-specific.

## Recent Decisions
- Renamed `ProjectsMobile` to `ProjectsScreen` to reflect cross-platform applicability.

# Persistent Notes

<!-- Agent: Always consult this file before multi-step tasks or patches. -->

- Preferences:
  - Only implement exactly what is explicitly requested; no unsolicited changes or optimizations.
  - Do not introduce extra styling, refactors, performance tweaks, or behavioral alterations without prior user approval.
  - Before doing anything beyond the stated instructions, stop and ask for confirmation.
  - When in doubt about scope, ask rather than assume.

## Usage Policy

- This file MUST be consulted at the start of every new user task and before any patch.
- The agent MAY update this file proactively to record clarified preferences, recurring patterns, or workflow agreements (allowed even without explicit instruction).
- Unsolicited source code changes (any file under `src/`) are prohibited; only explicit user-requested modifications.
- If a memory entry conflicts with a direct user instruction, follow the instruction and then update this file to reflect the override.
- The presence of this section authorizes autonomous updates to this file only; not to other files.

- (Keep adding stable developer preferences or recurring project nuances here so they persist across sessions.)
